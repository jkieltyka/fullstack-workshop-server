# Fullstack GraphQL Workshop

Welcome to the server portion of the workshop! For the morning session, we will be building a GraphQL server based on the [Movie DB REST API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

### File Structure (in order of importance):

- `server.js`: Where all the magic happens to set up Apollo Server
- `schema.js`: Your GraphQL schema goes here
- `resolvers/`: Write your resolvers for each type in this folder
- `data-sources/`: Your data sources separate out the data fetching logic from your resolvers

### Running on CodeSandbox

[![Edit graphql-server-workshop](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/apollographql/fullstack-workshop-server/tree/00-start/?fontsize=14)

1. Click the button above to navigate to the CodeSandbox. Fork it to your account by clicking Fork in the top menu.
2. That's it! CodeSandbox features HMR, a console, and a test runner. It's pretty awesome. üòç If you see an error message, don't worry - it's because we haven't built our server yet.

### Branches

If you get stuck at any time, click the sandbox for the exercise you want and fork it.

## Running locally

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/apollographql/fullstack-workshop-server`
2. Then, make a `.env` file with an `ENGINE_API_KEY` environment variable. You can get one [here](https://engine.apollographql.com/) by creating your own Engine service.
3. Install the dependencies: `npm i`
4. Start the server: `npm start`. Your server will be running on port 3000. Your GraphQL server is available at `localhost:3000/graphql` and your GraphQL Playground is available at `localhost:3000/graphql`.
